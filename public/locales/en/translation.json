  "about_summary": "I’m Benson Chien, a graduate student who loves creating and turning ideas into real projects. I started with game development and became proficient in C# and Unity, then gradually expanded my focus into AI, data analysis, and backend development to explore how to make interactive systems “smarter and more responsive.”I’m passionate about learning and enjoy building things—whether it’s programming, designing content, or planning marketing ideas. If it helps make a project better, I’m always willing to dive in. Through continuous creation, I hope to keep expanding my abilities and let people feel the care and thought I put into my work.",
